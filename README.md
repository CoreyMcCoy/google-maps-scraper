## Overview

This Google Maps Scraper is built with Next.js and let's users extract business listing data from Google Maps in **two distinct modes**:

### 1. Bulk Listings Scraper

- Enter a business category and location (e.g., "Plumbers in Waco")
- Scrapes all Google Maps listings for that query
- Extracts:
  - Business name
  - Service category
  - Phone number
  - Website URL
  - Rating & review count
  - Address
  - Google Business Profile (GBP) link
- Results can be copied directly to Google Sheets

### 2. Audit & Position Scraper

- Enter a search query, target business name, category, and average dollar amount
- Finds the position of the target business in the Google Maps results
- Calculates potential monthly revenue missed if not in the top 3
- Returns:
  - Position of the business in results
  - Total listings scraped
  - Potential monthly revenue missed
  - Calculation details
  - Top 5 listings found

Both modes use Puppeteer for browser automation and Cheerio for HTML parsing, with auto-scroll logic to load more results.

## Features
